# Time Tracker firefox extension

Timelog removed their "play" button (autostart an entry on this day from an earlier day). This extension is a feeble attempt to bring something similar back.

## Features

Start tracking time. Stop tracking time. Tracked time is summarized per day. Generate a HTML report of time per day.

That's it.

There are bugs.

## Further work

Fix bugs.

Eventually integrate tighter with Timelog to autofill their cells for the month.
